This motivated researchers to\r\npropose various link prediction and community detection algorithms. A lot of work has been done on network\r\ndiscovery(link prediction) and community detection individually. However, recently, there has been an attempt [[1]](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/wsdm15_jliu.pdf) to integrate these two problems hoping that each of these would help the other.\r\n\r\nDuring the network discovery and community detection process, it is possible that certain nodes would rapidly\r\nchange the communities as we discover the network while certain nodes would remain constant. The goal is to\r\nfind the characteristics of these nodes and understand why are they constant (or rapidly changing).\r\n\r\nThe following are the different stages of the project:\r\n* Understanding [[1]](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/wsdm15_jliu.pdf) end to end, demonstrated through a viva or presentation .\r\n* Implementation of the algorithm and reproduce the results mentioned in [[1]](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/wsdm15_jliu.pdf) \r\n* Proposing methods to detect constant nodes/rapidly changing nodes while detecting network and communities.\r\n* Studying the characteristics of these nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/wsdm15_jliu.pdf\r\n\r\n",
